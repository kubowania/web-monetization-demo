                The breathtaking village of Reine is located on the island of Moskenesøya on
                northern Norway's Lofoten archipelago. With red and white fishermen's huts
                dotting the shoreline and surrounding peaks of granite shooting out of the
                Reinefjorden, the village has earned a reputation as “the most beautiful
                place in the world.”

                known as Temasek—a name which comes from same root as the word tasek ('lake' in Malay).
                The statue's head represents the city's original name of Singapura (lion city in Sanskrit).
